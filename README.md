# Multiple-Choice Quiz

## Description

This project is an example of using JavaScript to handle user interaction and manipulate the DOM accordingly. It consists of a 9-question, multiple-choice, times quiz. 

Uses of JavaScript in this project include:

- Activating a timer and displaying the seconds as they count down.
- Manipulating the DOM, including HTML elements, as well as their 'class' and 'id' attributes.
- Keeping track of score and time.
- Handling click events on multiple targets.
- Handling click events on the same target differently, depending on the 'id' attribute.

## Installation

The Quiz can be accessed simply by opening the `index.html` file in any browser.

## Usage

Users can start the quiz by clicking the appropriate button, then answer questions and try to beat the ticking timer.

Time is subtracted from the times with each incorrect answer. After answering all questions, the user is given the opportunity to add their name or initials to the highscores page, which is stored in the browser's local storage.

The highscores page can also be accessed by clicking the appropriate button.
